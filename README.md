# Job Posting system project

The project has successfully implemented a Job Posting system using a MERN stack architecture, comprising two distinct sections: one for administrators and the other for candidates. To access the admin panel, users are required to log in using their username and password. Additionally, users have the option to register for their respective roles, and a password recovery feature is available through email or username.

Once an admin successfully logs in, they gain access to the admin panel, where they can add new job postings. This involves providing essential details such as Job Category, Job Type, and comprehensive job listings, including title, company information, tags, required skills, experience, job description, salary details, and custom additional fields. After creating a job posting, it is displayed in the job listings.

The admin panel also features an application section where administrators can view job applications. In this section, admins can access the resumes submitted by candidates and communicate their application status and response.

In the candidate section, individuals seeking job opportunities can view available jobs and submit their applications. Candidates are required to upload their resumes and provide their email for submission. They can also track the status of their applied jobs and view responses from employers.
